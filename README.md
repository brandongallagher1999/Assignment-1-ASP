## Description
- Front-End is built in React
- Back-End is built in ASP.NET Core
- A clone of Instagram built in ASP.NET
- The reason we chose to make an Instagram clone is because we enjoy the app and wanted to test our skills in ASP.NET to see if we could create a functioning clone of Instagram.

## OOP Concepts
    - Polymorphism / Inheritance is considered when creating new Controller classes which are important for creating new routes to our models and services.
    - Encapsulating things like our Database object for MongoDB is important so that we don't accidentally overwrite DB connection strings within our code.
